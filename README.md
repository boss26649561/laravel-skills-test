How long did you spend to complete this test? 
Much longer then expected, previous laravel was done in ELF environment so I didnt have to set it up locally. Finishing the parts without bonus took about 1-2 hours and the bonus took me over 2 hours to get working.

What was easy?
Everything was mostly easy except some of the stuff I have forgotten like setting up routes and using models correctly as it has been over 5 months since I last used laravel

What was hard?
Setting up laravel and the last bonus question, I have not used intervention image before so it took me much longer then everything else to get working. Image was resized thens stored into the database after as I am not too sure on how to save it the the post model itself.
